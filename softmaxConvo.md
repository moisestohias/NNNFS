Sure, implementing a backward pass for the softmax activation function requires careful handling of the gradients. Below, you'll find the backward softmax function and a testing snippet to verify it against PyTorch's implementation.

First, the backward softmax function:

```python
def backward_softmax(dout, x):
    # Forward softmax
    p, _ = softmax(x)
    # Diagonal
    diag = np.einsum('ij,ik->ijk', p, np.eye(p.shape[1]))
    # Outer product
    outer = np.einsum('ij,ik->ijk', p, p)
    # Jacobian
    jac = diag - outer
    # Multiply Jacobian with dout
    dx = np.einsum('ijk,ik->ij', jac, dout)
    return dx
```

Next, you can test this function against PyTorch's implementation using the following code snippet:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Dummy input
x_np = np.random.randn(5, 3)
x_torch = torch.tensor(x_np, requires_grad=True)

# Forward pass
out_np, _ = softmax(x_np)
out_torch = F.softmax(x_torch, dim=1)

# Dummy gradient for backward pass
dout_np = np.random.randn(*x_np.shape)
dout_torch = torch.tensor(dout_np)

# Backward pass
dx_np = backward_softmax(dout_np, x_np)
out_torch.backward(dout_torch)
dx_torch = x_torch.grad.numpy()

# Check if they are close
print("Is the backward implementation correct?", np.allclose(dx_np, dx_torch))
```

The above code snippet first performs a forward pass using both numpy's softmax function and PyTorch's softmax function. Then, it calculates the gradients with respect to the input for both implementations and checks if they are close enough.

Keep in mind that due to numerical precision, the `np.allclose` check might require a proper tolerance level, which you can adjust with the `atol` and `rtol` parameters.

Certainly! Let's work on implementing the backward pass of the softmax function and compare it to PyTorch's built-in softmax backward computation. Here's how we'll proceed:

1. **Define the Forward Softmax Function**: The provided code already defines the forward pass of the softmax function.
2. **Define the Backward Softmax Function**: We'll need to define the derivative of the softmax function with respect to its input.
3. **Test Against PyTorch**: We'll compare the backward pass computed by our implementation to the backward pass computed by PyTorch's autograd system.

### Step 1: Forward Softmax Function
You've already provided the code for the forward softmax function, which takes a batch of vectors and applies the softmax function to each vector.

### Step 2: Define the Backward Softmax Function
The gradient of the softmax function with respect to its input can be a bit complex. Let's denote the softmax function as $s(x)_i$, where ( i ) is the index of the class. Then the derivative of $s(x)_i$  with respect to x_j is given by:

$$
\frac{{\partial s(x)_i}}{{\partial x_j}} = s(x)_i \cdot (\delta_{ij} - s(x)_j)
$$

where $ \delta_{ij} $ is the Kronecker delta.

Now, let's implement the backward softmax function and define a function to test our softmax implementation against PyTorch's softmax function.

Great! The backward pass of our softmax function matches the result from PyTorch's autograd system within a tolerance of $1 \times 10^{-6}$. This means that our implementation of the backward softmax function is working correctly.

Certainly! My apologies for misunderstanding the requirement. Let's modify the backward softmax function to support batch processing, and we will test it again using a batch of inputs.

### Step 2 (Revised): Define the Backward Softmax Function with Batching
We will modify the backward softmax function to handle a batch of input vectors. The implementation will take into account the batch dimension and compute the gradient for each input vector in the batch.

Here's the revised code:

It appears that my code execution environment has been reset, which means the variables from the previous code snippets are no longer available. Let's redefine all the necessary components and execute them together to ensure the consistency of the test.

Here's the complete code snippet to define the forward softmax function, the revised backward softmax function with batching support, and the test code:

It seems I forgot to import the necessary libraries after the environment was reset. Let's import NumPy and PyTorch again and re-run the code.

The revised backward softmax function with batching support matches the result from PyTorch's autograd system within a tolerance of \(1 \times 10^{-6}\). This confirms that our implementation is correct and can handle a batch of input vectors.
